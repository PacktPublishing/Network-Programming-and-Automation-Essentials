# Router Simulator

All the code examples shown in chapter 6 were tested using this router simulation.

The simulator is based on QEMU and FRRouting. The instructions on how to download and run can be obtained from my github repository [brnuts/router-simulator](https://github.com/brnuts/router-simulator)
