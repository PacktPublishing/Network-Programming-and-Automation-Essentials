# Router Emulator

All the code examples shown in chapter 6 were tested using this router emulation.

The emulator is based on QEMU and FRRouting. The instructions on how to download and run can be obtained from my github repository [brnuts/router-emulator](https://github.com/brnuts/router-emulator)
